Joan Altés Depares
__________

Source code for my final project (bachelor thesis) for my Biomedical Engineering Degree. Project workflow was conducted as follows:
1. Data processing and exploratory analysis
2. Model hyperparameter tuning
3. Model training and testing
4. Model explanation

A total of 5 models were tested:
* Random Forest
* k-Nearest Neighbors
* Support Vector Classifier
* Deep Neural Network
* Long Short Term Memory

The dataset used for this project contains data from many anesthesia monitoring devices from a number of surgical procedures. The dataset belongs to the SPEC-M research group in Hospital Clínic in Barcelona and it is not publicly available.
